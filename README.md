## Taking it further

Hard to say how much we'll get through in the class, but following along is one thing, but tackling something on your own is quite another. 

I'd encourage you to keep hacking on this and finish whatever features we didn't build. 

A more "complete" version of this app is available here for reference: 

https://github.com/henrikjoreteg/library-client

And perhaps equally instructive, here's the code for the API:

https://github.com/henrikjoreteg/library-api

In addition, you may want to try adding the following: 

- Create a page that lists authors
- Link authors/books from the detail pages
